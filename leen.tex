Linus preferred source management methods are shown in relation \ref{math:linus-svn}.


\subsubsection{History, Bitkeeper}
An early scm, decent but why settle for less than perfect.
Git's flow is partially based on Bitkeeper but this was commercially distributed system which people did not like and could not even try to improve.

\subsubsection{Future, what features would a replacement have?}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What goes in, comes out. Undetected corruption is not an option.
\item Performance, if it takes too much time\ldots
\item Merging easy, Branching is trivial. Merging should be easy.
\item Diff, to show what and how much changed. But why only on files?
\end{enumerate}

=== The polite programmer presents - Torvalds Vs the world of CVS ===

Git > Mercurial > tar and patches > SVN > CVS

== Bitkeeper ==
An early scm, decent but why settle for less than perfect.
Git flow is partially based on Bitkeeper but this was commercially distributed system which people did not like and could not even try to improve.


== Wanted features, What do you need ==
  * What goes in, comes out. Undetected corruption is not an option.
  * Performance, if it takes too much time...
  * Merging easy, Branching is trivial. Merging should be easy.
  * Diff, to show what and how much changed. But why only on files?

== Distributed ==
  * Centralized collaboration is hard due to branch cost
  * No one central location
  * All as important, no 'more important' locations
  * NO single point of failure
  * It means more than offline, but even that is often very useful
  * It can be used as crude backup, as all copies can be used equally
  * However, branching is required for offline use on any scale
  * Trust, who can write to 'the' repo is 'fixed'
    * You can have a private repo, if you share others can ignore you or use it
    * Pull by choice
    * A release team can use this to create a 'verified' repo/branch 
  * Local commits can be shared, share experimental code between a smaller team
  * Network of trust
    * Only trust who you need and know you can trust
    * They trust who they know to be trustworty (in what they do at least)
    * At all points you can review and filter, and even review history

== Git as a tool ==
  * You can use Git just for merging, then put stuff in CVS. If you have to
  * Git makes merging easier than the competition
  * Merging can be delegated to the best knowing party
  * You dont need to see or share all existing branches
  * Branch names need not be unique across the globe
  * A super project can contain references to multiple projects which can be shared
  * Checksum everything, cryptographically secure, just for consistancy
    * Trust your data to be valid
    * Trust the data even from a shaky source, as long as you have the checksum
  * Git can track full history unless you force it not to
    * Tracks history regardless of the files the content lives in



=== Hg Git and the rest ===
Hg history is sacred.
Git lets you rebase history more easilly. @a

Git does not really cater to SVN users.

SourceTree is a GUI by atlassian
TortoiseHg is a shell extension

Eclipse has a plugin for .*

Hg cares about windows
Git can be sortof run on windows

Hg might be more backwards compatible

Hg can support shell written extensions using alliasses, allowing core features accessed

Commercial support for Hg can be bought

Hosting a git or Hg server can be done or done for you easilly


=== Why the git chose GIT ==
Things in git are immutable.
Safe git history (contradict earlier statement see @a)

Rewriting history can be done, and git sounds easier.

Branch sounds cooler than bookmark, and is actually a core feature.

Git allows partial files to be committed, leaving some stuff local if wanted.
Even if the file is huge.

Git blame -C -s
Track ownership/history even if you move stuff from a.file to b.file


=== Biz turtle ===

Do not anger the programmer, choose the right DVCS

== Cvs ==
  * Mature
  * Moving is broken
  * Symlinks are not secure
  * No atomical operations
  * Branching 'can' be done

== SVN ==
  * Newer than CVS
  * Atomical operations
  * Branching can be done
  * Not p2p

== GIT ==
  * Great
  * Speedy
  * Branching is fun
  * Full offline history
  * p2p
  * Windows sucks, git for windows just a small bit


== Hg ==
  * Git for dummies
  * Documented apperantly (git too but hey...)
  * p2p
  * no 2 parent merge
  * Extensions, no scripts
  * less powerfull



Keep using the system you all like, it saves time
SVN is server king.

Hosting can be bought, so can google((Do not make ME try, unless I can borrow some 10x10x10M diamonds and a forklift, and lunch)).


==== Group discussion ====

== Git ==
  * It is something different, it is fast, it is distributed, it is open source
  * It is better in the sense of performance (It is fast)
  * Branching is a native part of it; not so hard to make branches and commit them back on the chain
  * Its tracking mechanism is powerful
  * It goes a far way in insuring the integrity of your data
  * It keeps track of the content not the files, so renaming files won't
  * very complete, unlike mercurial which would require extra plugins for the same features
